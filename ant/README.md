#### Ant algorithm

Travel salesman problem solved with ant algorithm

You can change:
- amount of nodes
- alpha
- beta
- p
- Q
- amount of ants
- amount of iterations

After calculation you will see:
- Path for each ant for each iteration
- Best path
- Pheromones for each iteration

Also you can `drag nodes` and `fit to screen all nodes`.
