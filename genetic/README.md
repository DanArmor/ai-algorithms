#### Genetic algorithm

Travel salesman problem solved with genetic algorithm

You can change:
- amount of nodes
- crossover vs mutation %
- amount of populations (aka iterations)
- population size

After calculation you will see:
- Chromosomes for each population
- Best path
- Parents for each chromosome (2, if there was a crossover, 1 if mutation, or none, if it is an initial chromosome)

Also you can `drag nodes` and `fit to screen all nodes`.
